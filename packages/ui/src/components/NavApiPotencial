Perfect — you already have a **very strong technical and product vision**.
Let me now give you a **clear, realistic, step-by-step roadmap** that connects:

UI → Auth → Backend → Data → Mobile → Monetization

This is written for a **real SaaS product**, not a demo.

---

# 🧭 **MASTER ROADMAP – Polish Business App in Germany**

Target:

> In 6–9 months you have a **working MVP** that Polish entrepreneurs can really use.

---

# **PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (Weeks 1–3)**

> “If the foundation is wrong, everything breaks later.”

## 1️⃣ App skeleton (you already started)

You already have:

```text
Nav.tsx  
Dashboard  
Deadlines  
Documents  
Knowledge  
Experts  
```

Now formalize it.

### Folder structure

```
apps/web/
  app/
    (auth)/
    (dashboard)/
    api/
packages/
  ui/
  data/
  auth/
  db/
```

This allows:

* UI separate from logic
* API separate from frontend
* Easy scaling later

---

## 2️⃣ Authentication (Firebase first)

You were correct: **Dashboard must be behind login**.

### Implement:

Firebase Auth:

* Google
* Email/password
* Phone (optional later)

Flow:

```
User visits /
→ if not logged in → /login
→ if logged in → /dashboard
```

Store in Firestore:

```ts
User {
  id
  email
  language: 'pl'
  businessType: 'EINZELUNTERNEHMER'
  region: 'NRW'
  createdAt
}
```

This becomes the **brain** for everything later.

---

# **PHASE 2 — REAL DATA CORE (Weeks 4–7)**

This is your killer feature 🔥

## 3️⃣ Deadline Engine (you already designed this well)

You already have:

* `OfficialDeadline`
* static fallback
* date calculation
* urgency levels

Now do this:

```
User profile → businessType + region
→ DeadlineService.getDeadlines()
→ calculateDueDates()
→ show in Dashboard + Nav
```

Dashboard shows:

* Next deadline
* What it is
* How many days left
* What happens if missed

This creates **emotional value** (fear → relief).

---

## 4️⃣ Knowledge engine (searchable)

Your search bar must not be fake.

Create:

```
KnowledgeItem {
  id
  title.pl
  content.pl
  tags
  relatedDeadlines
}
```

Then:

* When user searches "VAT"
* Show:

  * deadlines
  * articles
  * document templates

This becomes your **Google for Polish businesses**.

---

# **PHASE 3 — DOCUMENTS & COMPLIANCE (Weeks 8–11)**

## 5️⃣ Documents

Implement:

* Upload
* Scan (later)
* Tag to deadline

Example:

```
Invoice → linked to → VAT return April
```

Now your app becomes **practical**, not just informational.

---

## 6️⃣ Export for Steuerberater

Generate:

* ZIP of documents
* CSV of income/expenses

This makes tax advisors love your product.

---

# **PHASE 4 — MOBILE-FIRST UX (Weeks 12–14)**

Polish workers use:
📱 Phones
📱 Tablets
❌ Not laptops

So:

* Tailwind responsive
* Bottom navigation on mobile
* Big buttons
* Calendar-style deadlines

This is a **mass adoption requirement**.

---

# **PHASE 5 — EXPERT MARKETPLACE (Weeks 15–18)**

## 7️⃣ Expert network

Add:

* Polish tax advisors
* Fixed price services

User clicks:

```
“Check my VAT” → pays 29€ → Polish tax advisor reviews
```

This is your **money engine**.

---

# **PHASE 6 — OFFICIAL DATA (Parallel)**

Start with:

* Static data
* Scraping BZSt
* Scraping IHK

Later:

* ELSTER API
* Bundesanzeiger

Always show:

```
Source: BZSt – last updated 2025-01
```

This builds **trust**.

# 🧠 Why this wins

Because you combine:

| What users fear    | What you give  |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Fines              | Reminders      |
| Confusion          | Polish clarity |
| Paper chaos        | Document hub   |
| No help            | Polish experts |
| German bureaucracy | One simple app |

---

Your MVP is complete when:

✅ User can log in
✅ Select business type
✅ See deadlines
✅ Get alerts
✅ Upload documents
